[^1] drowned in boots like mafia: 黑手党在执行秘密处决时，常会将受害者脚上绑上水泥或重物（如靴子），然后将其沉入水中。这里比喻一种被沉重束缚而无法自拔的死亡方式。

[^2] Peter and his monkey: 圣彼得在基督教传统中是天堂的守门人。此处“他的猴子”是一个非传统、略显荒诞的搭配，可能意在营造一种黑色幽默或超现实的场景。

[^3] baking manna and gas: “吗哪”（manna）是《圣经》中上帝赐予以色列人在旷野的食物。将其与“气体”（gas）并列，形成一种荒诞的对比，暗示在天堂的工作可能包括神圣但又无聊、甚至无意义的活动。

[^4] Crisco disco: Crisco 是一种常见的植物起酥油品牌。此短语可能是一个俚语或形容词，形容某人的动作笨拙、油腻、滑稽，或指一种过时的、带有嘲讽意味的舞蹈风格。

[^5] It's All Nice on Ice: 字面意思是“在冰上一切都很好”。这可能是一个具有讽刺意味的表达，暗示在冷漠、僵硬或危险的环境中，表面上一切似乎井然有序或被强行维持着一种虚假的“美好”，但其中可能蕴含着深层的问题或虚无感。
