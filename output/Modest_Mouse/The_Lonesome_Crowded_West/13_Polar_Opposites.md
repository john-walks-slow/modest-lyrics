# Polar Opposites 两极对立

Polar opposites don't push away\nIt's the same on the weekends as the rest of the days\nAnd I know I should go but I'll probably stay\nAnd that's all you can do about some things\n\nI'm tryin', I'm tryin' to\nDrink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away\nI'm tryin', I'm tryin' to\nDrink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away\n\nTwo one-eyed dogs, they're looking at stereos\nHi-fi gods[^1] try so hard to make their cars low to the ground\nThese vibrations oil its teeth[^2]\nPrimer gray is the color when you're done dying\n\nI'm tryin', I'm tryin' to\nDrink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away\nI'm tryin', I'm tryin' to\nDrink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
截然相反的事物不会互相推开

[^1] 字面意义为“高保真之神”，在此可能指那些对高品质音响（Hi-Fi）或汽车改装极度痴迷的人，带有一定的讽刺意味，暗示他们追求外在的表象或极致的体验。
[^2] 一个具有超现实感的意象表达，含义较为模糊。'its'可能指代前文的独眼狗、音响系统或汽车。'给牙齿上油'可能暗示某种磨损、消耗、持续的运作，或某种内在的滋养，具体含义留给听者解读。
