# Bankrupt on Selling 因出卖而破产

Well all the Apostles, they're sitting in swings
所有的使徒们，他们坐在秋千上
Saying, "I'd sell off my Savior for a set of new rings,
说着，“我会卖掉我的救主，只为几枚新戒指，
And some sandals with the style of straps that cling best to the era"
还有几双最符合那个时代潮流的系带凉鞋。”

So all of the businessers in their unlimited hell
于是所有的商人们，在他们无尽的地狱里
Where they buy and they sell and they sell all their trash
他们买卖着，把所有的垃圾都卖给彼此
To each other but they're sick of it all
但他们对这一切都已厌倦
And they're bankrupt on selling
他们因出卖而破产。

And all of the angels, they'd sell off your soul
所有的天使们，他们会卖掉你的灵魂
For a set of new wings and anything gold
只为几对新翅膀和任何金子
They remember the people they loved, their old friends
他们还记得那些他们爱过的人，他们的老朋友们。

And I've seen through 'em all, seen through 'em all
我已看透了他们所有人，看透了他们所有人
Seen through most everything
看透了几乎所有的一切
All the people you knew were the actors
你认识的所有人都是演员
All the people you knew were the actors
你认识的所有人都是演员。

Well, I'll go to college and I'll learn some big words
那么，我会上大学，我会学些大词
And I'll talk real loud, goddamn right I'll be heard
我会大声说话，该死的我肯定会被听到
You'll remember the guy that said all those big words
你会记得那个说了所有那些大词的人
He must've learned in college
他肯定是在大学里学的。

And it took a long time 'til I came clean with myself
花了很长时间我才对自己坦白
I come clean out of love with my lover
我坦白了，我已不再爱我的爱人
I still love her, loved her more
我仍然爱她，曾经更爱她
When she used to be sober and I was kinder
当她清醒而我更善良的时候。
