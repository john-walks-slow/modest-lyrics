# Out of Gas 没油了

Out of gas, out of road
没油了，没路了
Out of car, I don't know how I'm gonna go and
没车了，我不知该如何前行，而且
I had a drink the other day
我前几天喝了杯酒
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away[^1] and
观点就像小猫，我把它们送走了，而且
I had a drink the other day
我前几天喝了杯酒
I had a lot to say, and I said:
我有很多话要说，我说了：

You will come down soon too
你很快也会坠落
You will come down too soon
你会太快坠落
You will come down soon too
你很快也会坠落
You will come down, you'll come down, come down
你会坠落，你会坠落，坠落
You will come down soon too
你很快也会坠落
You will come down too soon
你会太快坠落
You will come down soon too
你很快也会坠落
Soon enough, you will come down, come down
很快地，你就会坠落，坠落

Out of gas, out of road
没油了，没路了
Out of car, I don't know how I'm gonna go and
没车了，我不知该如何前行，而且
I had a drink the other day
我前几天喝了杯酒
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away and

You will come down too soon

You will come down soon too

You will come down, you'll come down, come down
你会坠落，你会坠落，坠落
You will come down soon too
你很快也会坠落
You will come down too soon
你会太快坠落
You will come down soon too
你很快也会坠落

You'll come down, come down
你会坠落，坠落

[^1] 这是一个比喻。小猫通常数量众多、可爱但也可能带来负担。这里可能比喻观点太多，不值钱，或者易于抛弃，因此我可以轻易地把它们送给别人，显示出对自身观点的不重视或随意。
