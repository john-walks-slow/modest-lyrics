And his dad was oh-so-mad

Should have insured that planet before it crashed

Work your fingers to the bone[^1] sitting on your ass[^2]

I know now what I knew then

我如今知晓了当年所知

But I didn't know then what I know now

You should hide your kids while the dogs run wild

当野狗横行时，你应该藏好你的孩子

[^4] before he even had: 句式不完整，暗示“在他还没来得及造成任何影响、做任何事或甚至存在之前”。在此语境下表达了一种极端的后悔和毁灭性的念头。
