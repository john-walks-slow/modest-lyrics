[^1] did the porcupine: 直译为“做了豪猪”。这可能是一个虚构的舞步、一种隐晦的身体姿势，或者带有荒谬感的俚语，暗示某种不寻常或尴尬的举动，具体含义在歌词中并未明确。

[^2] steal your digits: “digits”在这里是俚语，特指电话号码，意为“要你的电话号码”。

[^3] pull each other's triggers: 字面意思是“互相扣动扳机”。这是一个强烈的隐喻，可能指互相挑衅、刺激对方做出过激行为，甚至共同走向毁灭，具体含义在语境中略带模糊。

[^4] You thought you were smokin’: “smokin’”是俚语，形容某人非常酷、有吸引力或令人印象深刻，此处带有讽刺意味，意为“你以为自己很了不起”。
