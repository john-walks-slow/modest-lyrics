[^1] Missed the Boat: 习语，意为“错失良机”、“错过了重要的机会或趋势”。

[^2] Our ideas held no water: 习语，字面意为“我们的想法盛不住水”，引申为“我们的想法站不住脚”、“不合逻辑或不可信”。

[^3] laugh all the way to Hell: 习语“laugh all the way to the bank”（一路笑着去银行，指赚大钱）的变体。这里反其道而行之，意为带着一种嘲讽或自嘲的姿态，面对不幸的结局或毁灭。

[^4] We made ourselves a pillar / We just used it as a crutch: “pillar”（支柱）象征力量与支撑，“crutch”（拐杖）象征依赖与软弱。歌词通过对比，讽刺了本应成为力量源泉的事物，却被用来掩盖或支撑自身的不足与依赖。

[^5] danced at our own wake: “wake”（守灵仪式）是为逝者举行的追悼活动。在自己的守灵仪式上跳舞，是一种荒诞的意象，暗示对自身失败或即将到来的厄运的无知、逃避，或是以一种黑色幽默的方式接受。

[^6] We owned all the tools ourselves / But not the skills to make a shelf with: 这是一个比喻，指出拥有完成某事所需的物质资源（工具），却缺乏必要的知识、技能或能力来实际利用这些资源。
