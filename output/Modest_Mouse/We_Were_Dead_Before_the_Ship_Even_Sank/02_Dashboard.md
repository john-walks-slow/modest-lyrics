# Dashboard 仪表盘

Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know

呃，它本可能，本应该比你所能想象的还要糟

Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio

哦，仪表盘融化了，但我们还有收音机

<br>

Oh, it should've been, could've been worse than you would ever know

哦，它本应该，本可能比你所能想象的还要糟

Well, you told me about nowhere, well, it sounds like someplace I'd like to go

呃，你告诉我关于虚无之地，嗯，那听起来像是我喜欢去的地方

Oh, it could've been, should've been worse than you would ever know

哦，它本可能，本应该比你所能想象的还要糟

Well, the windshield was broken, but I love the fresh air, you know

呃，挡风玻璃碎了，但我喜欢新鲜空气，你知道的

(The dashboard melted, but we still have the radio)

（仪表盘融化了，但我们还有收音机）

<br>

Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know, oh

呃，它本可能，本应该比你所能想象的还要糟，哦

(The dashboard melted, but we still have the radio)

Oh, we talked about nothing which was more than I wanted you to know-oh-oh-oh-oh

哦，我们聊了些无关紧要的事，这比我希望你知道的还要多——哦——哦——哦——哦

It would've been, could've been worse than it had even gone

它本可能，本应该比实际发生的情况还要糟

Well, the car was on blocks, but I was already where I want

呃，车子用砖块垫高了，但我已经身处我所向往之地

(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)

（那是不可能的，我们把它开得很好，我们把它开得很好）

<br>

Why should we ever even ever really even get to know?

我们为何要真正去了解这一切？

(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)

Oh, if the world don't like us it'll shake us just like we were a co-oh-oh-oh-old[^1]

哦，如果世界不喜欢我们，它就会把我们甩开，就像我们是个感冒——哦——哦——哦——哦

Well, we scheme, and we scheme, but we always blow it[^2]

呃，我们计划，我们谋划，但我们总是搞砸

We've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it

我们还没撞车，但我们可能还是应该把它拖走

Standing at a light switch to each east and west horizon

站在通往东西方地平线的电灯开关旁

Every dawn one yells, "Surprise," and in the evening one's consoling, sayin' "See it wasn't quite as bad as—"

每个黎明，一个大喊“惊喜”，傍晚时分，另一个安慰道：“看，情况并没有那么糟，像——”

I was patiently erasing and recording the wrong episodes

After you had proved my point wrong

在你证明我错了之后

It wasn't like I'd let it go, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

我可没打算就此放手，哦——哦——哦，哦——哦——哦

I just wanted to catch the last laugh of this show

我只是想看这出戏的最后一笑

Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio

哦，仪表盘融化了，但我们还有收音机

(The dashboard melted, but we ran it good, we ran it good)

（仪表盘融化了，但我们把它开得很好，我们把它开得很好）

Hard-wired to conceive, so much we'd have to stow it

生来就注定要构思，以至于我们不得不藏起太多

Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants

甚至需求也有需求，由更小巨人组成的微小巨人

Don't wear eyelids so I don't miss the last laugh of this show

我不戴眼睑，这样我就不会错过这场表演的最后一笑

[^1] co-oh-oh-oh-old: 歌曲中为“cold”的拖长发音，意指“感冒”。在此语境下，可能引申为“容易被甩掉或忽视的微不足道的事物”。

[^2] blow it: 俚语，意为“搞砸”、“把事情弄糟”。
