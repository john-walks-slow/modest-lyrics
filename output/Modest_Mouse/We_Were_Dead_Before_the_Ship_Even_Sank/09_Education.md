[^1] dog and pony: "dog and pony show"是一个英语习语，通常指为吸引人眼球而精心策划、浮夸甚至有些虚假的表演或展示，常带贬义，暗示其本质空洞或哗众取宠。

[^2] hit the roof, but I had aimed for the ceiling: "hit the roof"是一个英语习语，意为“勃然大怒”、“气得发疯”。此处与“aimed for the ceiling”（本意是瞄准天花板）形成文字游戏和对比，暗示虽然本想克制，但情绪却失控，爆发了更剧烈的反应。

[^3] Nostradamus: 诺查丹玛斯（Nostradamus，1503-1566），法国著名预言家、医生，以其著作《百诗集》而闻名，该书包含了许多被后世解读为预言的晦涩诗句。
