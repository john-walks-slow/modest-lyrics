<br>

[^1] milky teat: 习语，字面意指“乳头”，常象征母性的喂养、最初的起源或滋养。在此处暗喻“我”（机器人）并非由自然方式诞生，而是远离了自然的哺育和根源。

[^2] sacrificial calf: 习语，指被牺牲的小牛，常用于宗教献祭或比喻为无辜的受害者，其牺牲是为了他人的利益或目的。此处暗示“我”是被人类制造并牺牲的工具。

[^3] Steam engenius: 是“steam engine”（蒸汽机）和“ingenious”（聪明的，灵巧的）的合成词或文字游戏。既指“蒸汽”相关的机械，又暗示其具有“天才”般的智慧或能力。

[^4] dizzying length: 字面意为“令人眩晕的长度”，在此语境下可能指人类的言语过于冗长、繁复，甚至令人感到困惑或失去方向，与机器的简洁二进制形成对比。

[^5] Both halves are the better half: 这是一个反语或悖论。通常习语“better half”指配偶或更好的部分。此处说“两半都是更好的一半”，暗示了一种荒谬的平等或无意义的选择，即无论怎么看，都没有真正的“更好”，或者说都一样糟糕。

[^6] Stasis: 指停滞、静止状态，或一种动态平衡但没有实质性进展的状态。

[^7] a rickshaw getting pulled around by another rickshaw: 这是一个荒诞的意象，比喻一种无效的、循环往复的、自我消耗的状态，或是一种徒劳无功的努力，无法产生真正的向前动力。

[^8] stories Greek: 指希腊神话故事或古希腊戏剧。这些故事常包含宏大的命运、悲剧英雄、神人冲突等主题，暗示“我”的经历被赋予了类似的悲剧性和宿命论色彩。
