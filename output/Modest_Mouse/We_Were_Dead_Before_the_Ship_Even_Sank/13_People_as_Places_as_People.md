# People as Places as People 人是地，地是人

To answer the question, it'll probably take more

回答这个问题，可能还需要更多

If you're already there, well, you probably don't know

如果你已经身处其中，那你可能不知道

Well, we were the people that we wanted to know

呃，我们曾是我们想认识的人

And we're the places that we wanted to go

我们也是我们想去的地方

It's hard to get hold of and hard to let go

难以抓住，也难以放手

Always something we'd look for from the day we were born

从我们出生那天起就一直在寻找的东西

Instead we're the people that we wanted to know

反而我们成了我们想认识的人

<br>

And we're the places that we wanted to go

我们是我们想去的地方

Yeah, we're the places that we wanted to go

是啊，我们是我们想去的地方

We're the places that we wanted to go

我们是我们想去的地方

<br>

Always asking a question, and I don't want to know

总是提出一个问题，而我不想知道

Like the wind across strings that had finally let go

就像风吹过终于松开的琴弦

And the people you love but you didn't quite know

还有你爱却并不完全了解的人

They're the places that you wanted to go

他们就是你想去的地方

Bark at the neighbors and then bark at the door

对着邻居吼叫，然后对着门吼叫

A-snifflin' and wimperin' for someone to know

呜咽着，抽泣着，渴望有人了解

But we were the people that we wanted to know

但我们曾是我们想认识的人

<br>

And we're the places that we wanted to go

我们是我们想去的地方

Yeah, we're the places that we wanted to go

是啊，我们是我们想去的地方

Yeah, we're the places that we wanted to go

是啊，我们是我们想去的地方

<br>

It was not the intention, but we let it all go

那并非本意，但我们放任一切流逝

Well, it messed up the function and sure fucked up the flow

呃，它搞砸了功能，也确实搞乱了节奏

I hardly have people that I needed to know

我几乎没有我需要认识的人

'Cause you're the people that I wanted to know

因为你是我想要认识的人

All this scramblin' around, huntin' high and then low

所有这些四处奔波，到处搜寻

Lookin' for the face, love or somewhere to go

寻找那张脸，爱，或是某个地方可去

I hardly have places that I needed to go

我几乎没有我需要去的地方

<br>

'Cause you're the places that I wanted to go

因为你是我想要去的地方

Yeah, you're the places that we wanted to go

是啊，你就是我们想去的地方

Yeah, you're the places that we wanted to go

是啊，你就是我们想去的地方

<br>

We're the people that we wanted to know

我们是我们想认识的人

You shouldn't have to ask

你不该问

You shouldn't have to ask 'cause Pow!

你不该问，因为“砰！”

We your ripcord

我们是你的拉索

You shouldn't—

你不该——
