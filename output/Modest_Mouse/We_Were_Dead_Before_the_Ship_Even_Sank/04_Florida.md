# Florida 佛罗里达

Although we'd often wondered

尽管我们时常思索

It was no thing of wonder

这却并非什么奇迹

The shit that flew from our minds

那些从我们脑海中飞出的胡言乱语

While wearing stains of fresh fruit

身上沾着新鲜水果的污渍

And riding on shoes of horse glue

脚踏着马胶鞋

On this ridiculous climb

在这场荒谬的攀登中

With great tunnel vision

带着极度的隧道视野

We'd built ourselves a mission

我们为自己建造了一个任务

To ride on bullets inside

乘着子弹在里面前行

Oh, what a vain description

哦，多么徒劳的描述

Of what we have been missin'

对于我们一直错失的一切

So why would anyone try?

所以为何会有人尝试？

<br>

It was always worth it

这总是值得的

That's the part I seem to hide

那是我似乎隐藏的部分

And the busy ant empire

而繁忙的蚁群帝国

Put up the closing sign

挂起了打烊的牌子

<br>

I wasn't always cargo

我并非总是货物

I was once kind of my own

我曾一度拥有自我

I guess I'll pack up my mind

我想我会收拾我的思绪

Well, it took so much effort

嗯，不费力气竟然如此费力

Not to make an effort

哦，多么完美的设计

Oh, what a flawless design

<br>

It was always worth it

那是我似乎隐藏的部分

That's the part I seem to hide

而繁忙的蚁群帝国

And the busy ant empire

挂起了打烊的牌子

Put up the closing sign

<br>

Even as I left Florida

<br>

It was always worth it

那是我似乎隐藏的部分

That's the part I seem to hide

而繁忙的蚁群帝国

And the busy ant empire

已完全废弃了蜂巢

Has all deserted hive

这总是值得的

It was always worth it

那是我似乎隐藏的部分

That's the part I seem to hide

<br>

Even as I had left Florida

够远了，够远了，却还不够远

Far enough, far enough, wasn't far enough

似乎无法真正逃离自我

Couldn't quite seem to escape myself

够远了，够远了，远离佛罗里达

Far enough, far enough, far from Florida

我们都昏昏欲睡地开着定速巡航

We were all drowsin' in cruise control[^1]

够远了，够远了，却还不够远

Far enough, far enough, wasn't far enough

<br>

I stood on my heart's porch thinkin' "Oh, my God, I'll probably have to carry this whole load"

我记不起我是否曾尝试

I couldn't remember if I tried

我记不起我是否曾取出我的大脑

I couldn't remember if I took my brain out

如此直接地掷向目标

Threw it so directly at the goal

我记不起我是否—

I couldn't remember if I—

<br>

I could have my mind erased

却仍然无法确切知道我那些本就不知晓的事

And still not know exactly what I don't already know

<br>

Even as I had left Florida

<br>

[^1] drowsin' in cruise control: 这是一个形象的表达，指人在生活或工作中处于一种不假思索、随波逐流、缺乏主观能动性的状态，像车辆开启定速巡航后，驾驶员可以放松甚至打瞌睡一样。
