# Space Travel Is Boring 太空旅行很无聊

Won herself a pass to some far off moon
她为自己赢得了一张前往某个遥远月球的通行证
It was second class but what's to lose?
是二等舱，但这有什么损失呢？
And looking out her window she could more than assume
凝望窗外，她完全可以认为
That you can't see air or time
你无法看见空气或时间

She's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
她是这整个地方唯一的宇航员
They gave her a mirror so she could talk to a face
他们给了她一面镜子，让她可以对着一张脸说话
She still got plenty lonely but that's just the case
她依然感到非常孤独，但这就是情况
With time, time, time
伴随着时间，时间，时间

Started hearing voices sometime in June
大约在六月某个时候她开始听到声音
She knew she could go crazy but didn't think that soon
她知道自己可能会发疯，但没想到会这么快
Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon
如今她不再感到孤独，但她宁愿
Try, try, try, try
尝试，尝试，尝试，尝试

Man shot to the moon
人类登上了月球
I bought a paperback and want to go real soon
我买了本平装书，想很快就去
I'm shot to the moon
我登上了月球
Been there a half an hour, I wanna come home soon
在那儿待了半小时，我想很快回家
